Beginning commands:
1) npm init - sets up node server
2) npm i express body-parser mongoose concurrently (npm install packages we need)
3) npm i -D nodemon (nodemon is used to monitor for changes and then restart server, -D saves a development dependency)
4) npm install -g expo-cli (this is for react native apps)

1) npm run server

To check api:
1) use postman to make get, post, delete, etc requests
